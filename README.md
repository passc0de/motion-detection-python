# Python Motion Detection Program

## Description

A simple motion sensor/detection project that detects motion.
This software system is designed in Python that monitors the video
signal from one or more cameras and is able to detect if a significant
part of the picture has changed. Or in other words, it can detect
motion. The aim of detection is to separate the moving objects called
“foreground” from the static information called “foreground” in video
sequences. The effectiveness of moving object detection methods is
very important for the postprocessing of object tracking, target
classification, behavior understanding, and so on. Among all kinds of
moving object detection methods, the background subtraction is
considered as the most effective method to extract the foreground
object. This method compares the pixels of an image with a
background model and considers those that differ from the
background model as moving objects. So, the key of this method is
the effective background modeling, which directly affects the accuracy
and robustness of the whole detection system.
In today's competitive environment, the security concerns have grown
tremendously. Hence, it is imperative for one to be able to safeguard
one's property from worldly harms such as thefts, destruction of
property, people with malicious intent etc. Due to the advent of
technology in the modern world, the methodologies used by thieves
and robbers for stealing have been improving exponentially.
Therefore, it is necessary for the surveillance techniques to also
improve with the changing world. With the improvement in mass
media and various forms of communication, it is now possible to
monitor and control the environment to the advantage of the owners of
the property. The latest technologies used in the fight against thefts
and destruction are the video surveillance and monitoring. By using
the technologies, it is possible to monitor and capture every inch and 
second of the area in interest. However, so far, the technologies used
are passive in nature, i.e., the monitoring systems only help in
detecting the crime but do not actively participate in stopping or
curbing the crime while it takes place. Therefore, we have developed
a methodology to detect the motion in a video stream environment
and this is an idea to ensure that the monitoring systems not only
actively participate in stopping the crime, but do so while the crime is
taking place. Hence, a system is used to detect any motion in a live
streaming video.
